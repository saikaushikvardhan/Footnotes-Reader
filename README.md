# Footnotes-Reader
Creating a web extension to enable in-place footnote reading (kinda like Wikipedia) for paulg articles.

To use the extension: 
- Download the repo.
- Go to chrome://extensions/
- Unpack the extension and use it.


Will also try to publish the extension to chrome web store, meanwhile follow the above steps to use the extension. 

P.S. This works for most chromium browsers, might not work for firefox.
